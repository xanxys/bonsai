Description:

dd-plist
This library enables Java applications to work with property lists in various
formats.

You can parse existing property lists (e.g. those created by an iOS application)
and work with the contents on any operating system.

The library also enables you to create your own property lists from scratch and
store them in various formats.

The provided API mimics the Cocoa/NeXTSTEP API, granting access to the basic
functions of classes like NSDictionary, NSData, etc.

dd-plist has full support for the Android operating system. Consequently this
library can be of great help when it comes to porting iOS apps to Android.

Local Modifications:
- LICENSE file has been created for compliance purposes. Not included in
  original distribution.
- Made PropertyListParser.readAll react properly to InputStreams that sometimes
  read fewer bytes than are available.
- Rewrote some functions in ASCIIPropertyListParser.java to support characters
  outside of the 7-bit ASCII range.
- Support surrogate pairs from \u escaped chars in strings in
  ASCIIPropertyListParser.java.
- Allow \ escaping of characters that need not be escaped in
  ASCIIPropertyListParser.java.
